# A Collection of sass mixins

This is a collection of sass mixins according to my
latest post here: [http://vangeltzo.com/posts/collection_of_sass_mixins.html](http://vangeltzo.com/posts/collection_of_sass_mixins.html).

The collection consist of 4 mixins and a function

* 1. Centering mixin (with flex)
* 2. Overlay upon image mixin
* 3. Text truncate mixin
* 4. Color theme mixin
* and z-index function

> Note: No prefixes added, consider use [autopefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)

## How to import

There is a single scss file (`mixins.scss`).

To import mixins into your own scss file:

````scss
@import "mixins";
````

## Demo

You can see a demo of each mixin in action in the following links.
